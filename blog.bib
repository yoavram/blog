abstract = {The method of calculation is shown wherebt a formula has been derived that approximately the ratio of the rate of accumulation of advantageous mutant genes in a population that undergoes recombination to the rate in an otherwise non-recombining one. A table is given showing the ratios thus found for different frequencies of advantageous mutations and different degrees of their advantage. It is shown that this calculation does not apply for mutant genes that act advantageously only when in some special combinations with one or more other mutant genes, and that as far as these cases of special synergism are concerned recombining lines have no evolutionary advantage over non-recombining ones. Other limitations of the formula are pointed out and assessed. It is explained that most factors that retard the rate of recombination—for expample, linkage, rarity of outbreeding, intercalation of sexual reproduction between more frequent cycles of sexual propagation, and partial isolation between subpopulations—must usually cause little long-term retardation of the speed of advance that is fostered by recombination. Moreover, even where long-term evolutions has virtually ceased, recombination of mutant genes still confers upon a population the means of adopting short-term genetic “dodges”, that adjust it to ecological and “physical” changes in its circumstances, much more rapidly than would be possible for a comparable asexual population. Under conditions where only stability of type is needed, a non-recombining does not actually degenerate as a result of an excess of mutation over selection, after the usual equilibrium between these pressures is reached. However, a irreversible ratchet mechanism exists in the non-recombining species (unlike the recombining ones) that prevents selection, even if intensified, from reducing the mutational loads below the lightest that were in existence when the intensified selection started, whereas, contrariwise, “drift”, and what might be called “selective noise” must allow occasional slips of the lightest loads in the direction of increased weight.},

@article{Hill1966,
abstract = {(i) A computer simulation study has been made of selection on two linked loci in small populations, where both loci were assumed to have additive effects on the character under selection with no interaction between loci. If N is the effective population size, i the intensity of selection in standard units, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ measure the effects of the two loci on the character under selection as a proportion of the pheno-typic standard deviation and c is the crossover distance between them, it was shown that the selection process can be completely specified by Ni$\alpha$, Ni$\beta$and Nc and the initial gene frequencies and linkage disequilibrium coefficient. It is then easily possible to generalize from computer runs at only one population size. All computer runs assumed an initial population at linkage equilibrium between the two loci. Analysis of the results was greatly simplified by considering the influence of segregation at the second locus on the chance of fixation at the first (defined as the proportion of replicate lines in which the favoured allele was eventually fixed). (ii) The effects of linkage are sufficiently described by Nc. The relationship between chance of fixation at the limit and linkage distance (expressed as 2Nc/(2Nc + 1)) was linear in the majority of computer runs. (iii) When gene frequency changes under independent segregation were small, linkage had no effect on the advance under selection. In general, segregation at the second locus had no detectable influence on the chance of fixation at the first if the gene effects at the second were less than one-half those at the first. With larger gene effects at the second locus, the chance of fixation passed through a minimum and then rose again. For two loci to have a mutual influence on one another, their effects on the character under selection should not differ by a factor of more than two. (iv) Under conditions of suitable relative gene effects, the influence of segregation at the second locus was very dependent on the initial frequency of the desirable allele. The chance of fixation at the first, plotted against initial frequency of the desirable allele at the second, passed through a minimum when the chance of fixation at the second locus was about 0·8. (v) A transformation was found which made the influence of segregation at the second locus on the chance of fixation at the first almost independent of initial gene frequency at the first and of gene effects at the first locus when these are small. (vi) In the population of gametes at final fixation, linkage was not at equilibrium and there was an excess of repulsion gametes. (vii) The results were extended to a consideration of the effect of linkage on the limits under artificial selection. Linkage proved only to be of importance when the two loci had roughly equal effects on the character under selection. The maximum effect on the advance under selection occurred when the chance of fixation at both of the loci was between 0·7 and 0·8. When the advance under selection is most sensitive to changes in recombination value, a doubling of the latter in no case increased the advance under selection by more than about 6\%. The proportion selected to give maximum advance under individual selection (0·5 under independent segregation) was increased, but only very slightly, when linkage is important. (viii) These phenomena could be satisfactorily accounted for in terms of the time scale of the selection process and the effective size of the population within which changes of gene frequency at the locus with smaller effect must take place.},

abstract = {The controversy over the evolutionary advantage of recombination initially discovered by Fisher and by Muller is reviewed. Those authors whose models had finite-population effects found an advantage of recombination, and those whose models had infinite populations found none. The advantage of recombination is that it breaks down random linkage disequilibrium generated by genetic drift. Hill and Robertson found that the average effect of this randomly-generated linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked loci to interfere with each other's response to selection, even where there was no gene interaction between the loci. This effect is shown to be identical to the original argument of Fisher and Muller. It also predicts the "ratchet mechanism" discovered by Muller, who pointed out that deleterious mutants would more readily increase in a population without recombination. Computer simulations of substitution of favorable mutants and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential correctness of the original Fisher-Muller argument and the reality of the Muller ratchet mechanism. It is argued that these constitute an intrinsic advantage of recombination capable of accounting for its persistence in the face of selection for tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly capable of accounting for its origin.},

If n0 is large (⩾25), deleterious mutations will accumulate very slowly, and independently of each other; if n0 is small (<1), the rate of accumulation of deleterious mutations will be greater than a natural population could plausibly bear; an estimate of the speed of the Ratchet for intermediate values of n0 is made. It is pointed out that the frequency distribution for the numbers of individuals carrying k mutants will retain its shape, but will move bodily to the right at the same average speed as the Ratchet. When favourable mutations also occur, the frequency distributions can move right of left; an estimate of the probability that any particular step is right or left is made, and it is shown that, for a given net rate of arrisal of deleterious mutations, the greater the rate of beneficial mutation, the greater the chance that beneficial mutations will accumulate.},

abstract = {In terms of evolution and fitness, the most significant spontaneous mutation rate is likely to be that for the entire genome (or its nonfrivolous fraction). Information is now available to calculate this rate for several DNA-based haploid microbes, including bacteriophages with single- or double-stranded DNA, a bacterium, a yeast, and a filamentous fungus. Their genome sizes vary by approximately 6500-fold. Their average mutation rates per base pair vary by approximately 16,000-fold, whereas their mutation rates per genome vary by only approximately 2.5-fold, apparently randomly, around a mean value of 0.0033 per DNA replication. The average mutation rate per base pair is inversely proportional to genome size. Therefore, a nearly invariant microbial mutation rate appears to have evolved. Because this rate is uniform in such diverse organisms, it is likely to be determined by deep general forces, perhaps by a balance between the usually deleterious effects of mutation and the physiological costs of further reducing mutation rates.},

@article{Gessler1995,
abstract = {An analysis of mutation accumulation in finite, asexual populations shows that by modeling discrete individuals, a necessary condition for mutation–selection balance is often not met. It is found that over a wide parameter range (whenever N e−$\mu$/s < 1, where N is the population size, $\mu$ is the genome-wide mutation rate, and s is the realized strength of selection), asexual populations will fail to achieve mutation–selection balance. This is specifically because the steady-state strength of selection on the best individuals is too weak to counter mutation pressure. The discrete nature of individuals means that if the equilibrium level of mutation and selection is such that less than one individual is expected in a class, then equilibration towards this level acts to remove the class. When applied to the classes with the fewest mutations, this drives mutation accumulation. This drive is in addition to the well-known identification of the stochastic loss of the best class as a mechanism for Muller's ratchet. Quantification of this process explains why the distribution of the number of mutations per individual can be markedly hypodispersed compared to the Poisson expectation. The actual distribution, when corrected for stochasticity between the best class and the mean, is akin to a shifted negative binomial. The parameterization of the distribution allows for an approximation for the rate of Muller's ratchet when N e−$\mu$/s < 1. The analysis is extended to the case of variable selection coefficients where incoming mutations assume a distribution of deleterious effects. Under this condition, asexual populations accumulate mutations faster, yet may be able to survive longer, than previously estimated.},

Reduced fitness from deleterious-mutation accumulation may be important in the evolution of sex, mate choice, and diploid life-cycles, and in the extinction of small populations. Few empirical data exist, however. Minimum estimates of the genomic deleterious-mutation rate for viability in Drosophila melanogaster are surprisingly high, leading to the conjecture that the rate for total fitness could exceed 1.0 mutation per individual per generation. Here we use Escherichia coli to provide an estimate of the genomic deleterious-mutation rate for total fitness in a microbe. We estimate that the per-microbe rate of deleterious mutations is in excess of 0.0002.},

We consider here whether high mutation rates might play an important role in adaptive evolution. Models of large, asexual, clonal populations adapting to a new environment show that strong mutator genes (such as those that increase mutation rates by 1,000-fold) can accelerate adaptation, even if the mutator gene remains at a very low frequency (for example, 10[-5]). Less potent mutators (10 to 100-fold increase) can become fixed in a fraction of finite populations. The parameters of the model have been set to values typical for Escherichia coli cultures, which behave in a manner similar to the model in long-term adaptation experiments.},

From theoretical exploration of such ‘clonal interference’, we have derived (1) a fixation probability for beneficial mutations, (2) an expected substitution rate, (3) an expected coefficient of selection for realized substitutions, (4) an expected rate of fitness increase, (5) the probability that a beneficial mutation transiently achieves polymorphic frequency (≥ 1\%), and (6) the probability that a beneficial mutation transiently achieves majority status. Based on (2) and (3), we were able to estimate the beneficial mutation rate and the distribution of mutational effects from changes in mean fitness in an evolving E. coli population.},

abstract = {I investigate the hypothesis that mutation rates in natural populations are determined by a balance between: (1) selection against deleterious mutations favouring lower mutation rates, and (2) selection opposing further reduction of the mutation rate, resulting from the costs incurred by more stringent proof-reading and repair (for example, a reduction in the rate of DNA replication). The influence of advantageous mutations is assumed to be negligible. In a previous paper, I analysed the dynamics of a modifier of the mutation rate in a large sexual population, where (infinitesimally rare) deleterious alleles segregate at an infinite number of unlinked loci with symmetric multiplicative fitness effects. A simple condition was obtained for a modifier allele to increase in frequency. Remarkably, this condition does not depend on the allele frequencies at the modifier locus. Here, I show that (as a consequence), given any set of possible values of the mutation rate (any set of possible modifier alleles), there always exists a single globally stable value of the mutation rate. This is an unusually strong form of "evolutionary stability" for a sexual population. Less surprisingly the optimum mutation rate in an asexual population has similar stability properties. Furthermore, in the case of an asexual population, it is not necessary to make any special assumptions about the selection acting against deleterious mutations, except that a deterministic mutation-selection equilibrium exists. I present a simple method for identifying the evolutionarily stable value of the mutation rate, given the function alpha(U) relating the value of the mutation rate to the fitness cost of maintaining this rate. I also argue that if there is a highly conserved relationship between the rate of replication per base, and the rate of mutation per base, and if this relationship has the form of a power law, then the remarkable uniformity of the per genome mutation rate in DNA based microbes can be explained.},

abstract = {Selection of mutator alleles, increasing the mutation rate up to 10, 000-fold, has been observed during in vitro experimental evolution. This spread is ascribed to the hitchhiking of mutator alleles with favorable mutations, as demonstrated by a theoretical model using selective parameters corresponding to such experiments. Observations of unexpectedly high frequencies of mutators in natural isolates suggest that the same phenomenon could occur in the wild. But it remains questionable whether realistic in natura parameter values could also result in selection of mutators. In particular, the main parameters of adaptation, the size of the adapting population and the height and steepness of the adaptive peak characterizing adaptation, are very variable in nature. By simulation approach, we studied the effect of these parameters on the selection of mutators in asexual populations, assuming additive fitness. We show that the larger the population size, the more likely the fixation of mutator alleles. At a large population size, at least four adaptive mutations are needed for mutator fixation; moreover, under stronger selection stronger mutators are selected. We propose a model based on multiple mutations to illustrate how second-order selection can optimize population fitness when few favorable mutations are required for adaptation.},

abstract = {A new method is presented for analysing the dynamics of a classical model where infinitesimally rare alleles segregate at an infinite number of unlinked loci, and where the alleles at different loci have equivalent effects. The dynamics of the distribution of the number of rare alleles per individual (the "phenotypic distribution") can be followed without knowing the frequencies of individual genotypes. Meiosis and random union of gametes have a very simple effect on the factorial cumulants of the phenotypic distribution which are consequently the natural set of variables to follow. An exact solution is presented for the dynamics of rare alleles under mutation and multiplicative selection. This solution has a simple representation in terms of the factorial cumulants. Unlike the QLE (quasi-linkage equilibrium) solution, this solution applies even when the population is far from linkage equilibrium. This approach is extended to analyse the joint dynamics of infinitesimally rare alleles at an infinite number of unlinked loci, together with a locus (with arbitrary allele frequencies) with which they interact. This more general method is used to investigate (1) the joint dynamics of a modifier of the mutation rate, together with deleterious alleles under mutation and multiplicative selection, and (2) the fate of an allele that ameliorates or exacerbates the fitness effects of deleterious alleles. When a new modifier allele causes a large change in the mutation rate, strong linkage disequilibrium is generated during its progress. However, using this new approach based on factorial cumulants, it is found that a remarkably simple invasion condition applies to alleles at the modifier locus, even when strong linkage disequilibrium is generated.},

This method is applied to the problem of calculating the frequency of a mutator subpopulation, at equilibrium between mutation and indirect selection due to association with deleterious mutations. Many mutator alleles are produced by loss-of-function mutations in polymerase or mismatch repair genes. Previous calculations have ignored the fact that this creates a flux of higher fitness individuals into the mutator subpopulation. This flux raises the mean fitness of the mutator subpopulation, and when this factor is taken into account, the frequency of the mutator may be more than an order of magnitude greater than recent theoretical work has suggested.},

abstract = {Natural selection can adjust the rate of mutation in a population by acting on allelic variation affecting processes of DNA replication and repair. Because mutation is the ultimate source of the genetic variation required for adaptation, it can be appealing to suppose that the genomic mutation rate is adjusted to a level that best promotes adaptation. Most mutations with phenotypic effects are harmful, however, and thus there is relentless selection within populations for lower genomic mutation rates. Selection on beneficial mutations can counter this effect by favoring alleles that raise the mutation rate, but the effect of beneficial mutations on the genomic mutation rate is extremely sensitive to recombination and is unlikely to be important in sexual populations. In contrast, high genomic mutation rates can evolve in asexual populations under the influence of beneficial mutations, but this phenomenon is probably of limited adaptive significance and represents, at best, a temporary reprieve from the continual selection pressure to reduce mutation. The physiological cost of reducing mutation below the low level observed in most populations may be the most important factor in setting the genomic mutation rate in sexual and asexual systems, regardless of the benefits of mutation in producing new adaptive variation. Maintenance of mutation rates higher than the minimum set by this "cost of fidelity" is likely only under special circumstances.},

abstract = {Bacterial mutation rates can increase and produce genetic novelty, as shown by in vitro and in silico experiments. Despite the cost due to a heavy deleterious mutation load, mutator alleles, which increase the mutation rate, can spread in asexual populations during adaptation because they remain associated with the rare favorable mutations they generate. This indirect selection for a genetic system generating diversity (second-order selection) is expected to be highly sensitive to changes in the dynamics of adaptation. Here we show by a simulation approach that even rare genetic exchanges, such as bacterial conjugation or transformation, can dramatically reduce the selection of mutators. Moreover, drift or competition between the processes of mutation and recombination in the course of adaptation reveal how second-order selection is unable to optimize the rate of generation of novelty.},

abstract = {We have examined the composition of members of mutator populations of Escherichia coli by employing an extensive set of phenotypic screens that allow us to monitor the function of >700 genes, constituting approximately 15\% of the genome. We looked at mismatch repair deficient cells after repeated cycles of single colony isolation on rich medium to generate lineages that are forced through severe bottlenecks, and compared the results to those for wild-type strains. The mutator lineages continued to accumulate mutations rapidly with each increasing cycle of colony isolation. By the end of the 40th cycle, after approximately 1000 generations, most of the lineages had reduced colony size, 4\% had died out, 55\% had auxotrophic requirements (increasing to 80\% after 60 cycles), and 70\% had defects in at least one sugar or catabolic pathway. In addition, 33\% had a defect in cell motility, and 26\% were either temperature-sensitive or cold-sensitive lethals. On the other hand, only 3\% of the wild-type lineages had detectable mutations of any type after 40 cycles. By the 60th cycle, the typical mutator cell carried 4-5 inactive genes among the 15\% of the genome being monitored, indicating that the average cell carried at least 24-30 inactivated genes distributed throughout the genome. Remarkably, 30\% of the lineages had lost the ability to utilize xylose as a carbon source. DNA sequencing revealed that most of the Xyl(-) mutants had a frameshift in a run of eight G's (GGGGGGGG) in the xylB gene, either adding or deleting one -G-. Further analysis indicated that rendering E. coli deficient in mismatch repair unmasks hypermutable sites in certain genes or intergenic regions. Growth curves and competition tests on lineages that passed through 90 cycles of single colony isolation showed that all lineages suffered reduced fitness. We discuss these results in terms of the value of mutators in cellular evolution.},

We show that when selection against deleterious alleles is weak, beneficial alleles that confer a selective advantage that is small relative to U have greatly reduced probabilities of fixation. We discuss the consequences of this effect for the distribution of effects of alleles fixed during adaptation. We show that a selective sweep will increase the fixation probabilities of other beneficial mutations arising during some short interval afterward. We use the calculated fixation probabilities to estimate the expected rate of fitness improvement in an asexual population when beneficial alleles arise continually at some low rate proportional to U. We estimate the rate of mutation that is optimal in the sense that it maximizes this rate of fitness improvement. Again, this analysis relaxes the assumption made previously that selection against deleterious alleles is stronger than on beneficial alleles.},

abstract = {Although much theory depends on the genome-wide rate of deleterious mutations, good estimates of the mutation rate are scarce and remain controversial. Furthermore, mutation rate may not be constant, and a recent study suggests that mutation rates are higher in mildly stressful environments. If mutation rate is a function of condition, then individuals carrying more mutations will tend to be in worse condition and therefore produce more mutations. Here I examine the mean fitnesses of sexual and asexual populations evolving under such condition-dependent mutation rates. The equilibrium mean fitness of a sexual population depends on the shape of the curve relating fitness to mutation rate. If mutation rate declines synergistically with increasing condition the mean fitness will be much lower than if mutation rate declines at a diminishing rate. In contrast, asexual populations are less affected by condition-dependent mutation rates. The equilibrium mean fitness of an asexual population only depends on the mutation rate of the individuals in the least loaded class. Because such individuals have high fitness and therefore a low mutation rate, asexual populations experience less genetic load than sexual populations, thus increasing the twofold cost of sex.},

However, there is no direct evidence showing a positive correlation between mutation and adaptation rates among RNA viruses. Moreover, theoretical work does not argue in favor of this prediction. We used a series of vesicular stomatitis virus clones harboring single amino acid substitutions in the RNA polymerase to demonstrate that changes inducing enhanced fidelity paid a fitness cost, but that there was no positive correlation between mutation an adaptation rates. We demonstrate that the observed mutation rate in vesicular stomatitis virus can be explained by a trade-off between replication rate and replication fidelity.},

Homeostasis and physiological plasticity buffer changes within the lifetime of an organism, while stochastic developmental programs and hypermutability track changes on longer time-scales. An alternative long-term mechanism is "genetic potential"--a heightened sensitivity to the effects of mutation that facilitates rapid evolution to novel states. Using a transparent mathematical model, we illustrate the concept of genetic potential and show that as environmental variability decreases, the evolving population reaches three distinct steady state conditions: (1) organismal flexibility, (2) genetic potential, and (3) genetic robustness. As a specific example of this concept we examine fluctuating selection for hydrophobicity in a single amino acid. We see the same three stages, suggesting that environmental fluctuations can produce allele distributions that are distinct not only from those found under constant conditions, but also from the transient allele distributions that arise under isolated selective sweeps.},

abstract = {Evolutionary success of bacteria relies on the constant fine-tuning of their mutation rates, which optimizes their adaptability to constantly changing environmental conditions. When adaptation is limited by the mutation supply rate, under some conditions, natural selection favours increased mutation rates by acting on allelic variation of the genetic systems that control fidelity of DNA replication and repair. Mutator alleles are carried to high frequency through hitchhiking with the adaptive mutations they generate. However, when fitness gain no longer counterbalances the fitness loss due to continuous generation of deleterious mutations, natural selection favours reduction of mutation rates. Selection and counter-selection of high mutation rates depends on many factors: the number of mutations required for adaptation, the strength of mutator alleles, bacterial population size, competition with other strains, migration, and spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity. Such modulations of mutation rates may also play a role in the evolution of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {In bacteria, recombination is a rare event, not a part of the reproductive process. Nevertheless, recombination -- broadly defined to include the acquisition of genes from external sources, i.e., horizontal gene transfer (HGT) -- plays a central role as a source of variation for adaptive evolution in many species of bacteria. Much of niche expansion, resistance to antibiotics and other environmental stresses, virulence, and other characteristics that make bacteria interesting and problematic, is achieved through the expression of genes and genetic elements obtained from other populations of bacteria of the same and different species, as well as from eukaryotes and archaea. While recombination of homologous genes among members of the same species has played a central role in the development of the genetics and molecular biology of bacteria, the contribution of homologous gene recombination (HGR) to bacterial evolution is not at all clear. Also, not so clear are the selective pressures responsible for the evolution and maintenance of transformation, the only bacteria-encoded form of HGR. Using a semi-stochastic simulation of mutation, recombination, and selection within bacterial populations and competition between populations, we explore (1) the contribution of HGR to the rate of adaptive evolution in these populations and (2) the conditions under which HGR will provide a bacterial population a selective advantage over non-recombining or more slowly recombining populations. The results of our simulation indicate that, under broad conditions: (1) HGR occurring at rates in the range anticipated for bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacillus subtilis will accelerate the rate at which a population adapts to environmental conditions; (2) once established in a population, selection for this capacity to increase rates of adaptive evolution can maintain bacteria-encoded mechanisms of recombination and prevent invasion of non-recombining populations, even when recombination engenders a modest fitness cost; and (3) because of the density- and frequency-dependent nature of HGR in bacteria, this capacity to increase rates of adaptive evolution is not sufficient as a selective force to provide a recombining population a selective advantage when it is rare. Under realistic conditions, homologous gene recombination will increase the rate of adaptive evolution in bacterial populations and, once established, selection for higher rates of evolution will promote the maintenance of bacteria-encoded mechanisms for HGR. On the other hand, increasing rates of adaptive evolution by HGR is unlikely to be the sole or even a dominant selective pressure responsible for the original evolution of transformation.},

abstract = {Mutation rate is an important determinant of evolvability. The optimal mutation rate for different organisms during evolution has been modeled in silico and tested in vivo, predominantly through pairwise comparisons. To characterize the fitness landscape across a broad range of mutation rates, we generated a panel of 66 DNA polymerase I mutants in Escherichia coli with comparable growth properties, yet with differing DNA replication fidelities, spanning 10(3)-fold higher and lower than that of wild type. These strains were competed for 350 generations in six replicate cultures in two different environments. A narrow range of mutation rates, 10- to 47-fold greater than that of wild type, predominated after serial passage. Mutants exhibiting higher mutation rates were not detected, nor were wild-type or antimutator strains. Winning clones exhibited shorter doubling times, greater maximum culture densities, and a growth advantages in pairwise competition relative to their precompetition ancestors, indicating the acquisition of adaptive phenotypes. To investigate the basis for mutator selection, we undertook a large series of pairwise competitions between mutator and wild-type strains under conditions where, in most cases, one strain completely overtook the culture within 18 days. Mutators were the most frequent winners but wild-type strains were also observed winning, suggesting that the competitive advantage of mutators is due to a greater probability of developing selectably advantageous mutations rather than from an initial growth advantage conferred by the polymerase variant itself. Our results indicate that under conditions where organism fitness is not yet maximized for a particular environment, competitive adaptation may be facilitated by enhanced mutagenesis.},

abstract = {Evolutionary theory suggests that low mutation rates should favor the persistence of asexuals. Additionally, given the observation that most nonneutral mutations are deleterious, asexuality may strengthen selection for reduced mutation rates. This reciprocal relationship raises the possibility of a positive feedback loop between sex and mutation rate. We explored the consequences of this evolutionary feedback with an individual-based model in which a sexual population is continually challenged by the introduction of asexual clones. We found that asexuals were more likely to spread in a population when mutation rates were able to evolve relative to a model in which mutation rates were held constant. In fact, under evolving mutation rates, asexuals were able to spread to fixation even when sexuals faced no cost of sex whatsoever. The added success of asexuals was the result of their ability to evolve lower mutation rates and thereby slow the process of mutation accumulation that otherwise limited their spread. Given the existence of ample mutation rate variation in natural populations, our findings show that the evolutionary feedback between sex and mutation rate may intensify the "paradox of sex," supporting the argument that deleterious mutation accumulation alone is likely insufficient to overcome the reproductive advantage of asexual competitors in the short term.},

In this study, we estimated the rate and mean effect of spontaneous mutations that affect fitness in a mutator strain of Escherichia coli and review some of the estimation methods associated with mutation accumulation (MA) experiments. We performed an MA experiment where we followed the evolution of 50 independent mutator lines that were subjected to repeated bottlenecks of a single individual for approximately 1150 generations. From the decline in mean fitness and the increase in variance between lines, we estimated a minimum mutation rate to deleterious mutations of 0.005 (+/-0.001 with 95\% confidence) and a maximum mean fitness effect per deleterious mutation of 0.03 (+/-0.01 with 95\% confidence). We also show that any beneficial mutations that occur during the MA experiment have a small effect on the estimate of the rate and effect of deleterious mutations, unless their rate is extremely large. Extrapolating our results to the wild-type mutation rate, we find that our estimate of the mutational effects is slightly larger and the inferred deleterious mutation rate slightly lower than previous estimates obtained for non-mutator E. coli.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem of asexual adaptation is that beneficial substitutions are not efficiently accumulated in large populations: Beneficial mutations often go extinct because they compete with one another in going to fixation. It has been argued that such clonal interference may have led to the evolution of sex and recombination in well-mixed populations. Here, we study clonal interference, and mechanisms of its mitigation, in an evolutionary model of spatially structured populations with uniform selection pressure. Clonal interference is much more prevalent with spatial structure than without, due to the slow wave-like spread of beneficial mutations through space. We find that the adaptation speed of asexuals saturates when the linear habitat size exceeds a characteristic interference length, which becomes shorter with smaller migration and larger mutation rate. The limiting speed is proportional to $\mu$(1/2) and $\mu$(1/3) in linear and planar habitats, respectively, where the mutational supply $\mu$ is the product of mutation rate and local population density. This scaling and the existence of a speed limit should be amenable to experimental tests as they fall far below predicted adaptation speeds for well-mixed populations (that scale as the logarithm of population size). Finally, we show that not only recombination, but also long-range migration is a highly efficient mechanism of relaxing clonal competition in structured populations. Our conservative estimates of the interference length predict prevalent clonal interference in microbial colonies and biofilms, so clonal competition should be a strong driver of both genetic and spatial mixing in those contexts.},

Agrawal (J. Evol. Biol.15, 2002, 1004) explored the basic properties of fitness-dependent mutation rate (FDMR) in infinite populations and reported some heuristic results for finite populations. The key parameter governing how infinite populations evolve under FDMR is the curvature (k) of the relationship between fitness and mutation rate. We extend Agrawal's analysis to finite populations and consider dominance and epistasis. In finite populations, the probability of long-term existence depends on k. In sexual populations, positive curvature leads to low equilibrium mutation rate, whereas negative curvature results in high mutation rate. In asexual populations, negative curvature results in rapid extinction via 'mutational meltdown', whereas positive curvature sometimes allows persistence. We speculate that fitness-dependent mutation rate may provide the conditions for genetic architecture to diverge between sexual and asexual taxa.},

Nevertheless, when the mutation rate per cell division is extrapolated to the length of the sexual cycle for this protist, the measure obtained is comparable to that for multicellular species with similar genome sizes. Because Paramecium has a transcriptionally silent germ-line nucleus, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that natural selection operates on the cumulative germ-line replication fidelity per episode of somatic gene expression, with the germ-line mutation rate per cell division evolving downward to the lower barrier imposed by random genetic drift. We observe ciliate-specific modifications of widely conserved amino acid sites in DNA polymerases as one potential explanation for unusually high levels of replication fidelity.},

Our results suggest that if beneficial mutations occur, even rarely, then stress-induced hypermutation is advantageous for bacteria at both the individual and the population levels and that it is likely to evolve in populations of bacteria in a wide range of conditions because it is favored by selection. These results imply that mutations are not, as the current view holds, uniformly distributed in populations, but rather that mutations are more common in stressed individuals and populations. Because mutation is the raw material of evolution, these results have a profound impact on broad aspects of evolution and biology.},

abstract = {Mutation dictates the tempo and mode of evolution, and like all traits, the mutation rate is subject to evolutionary modification. Here, we report refined estimates of the mutation rate for a prokaryote with an exceptionally small genome and for a unicellular eukaryote with a large genome. Combined with prior results, these estimates provide the basis for a potentially unifying explanation for the wide range in mutation rates that exists among organisms. Natural selection appears to reduce the mutation rate of a species to a level that scales negatively with both the effective population size (N(e)), which imposes a drift barrier to the evolution of molecular refinements, and the genomic content of coding DNA, which is proportional to the target size for deleterious mutations. As a consequence of an expansion in genome size, some microbial eukaryotes with large N(e) appear to have evolved mutation rates that are lower than those known to occur in prokaryotes, but multicellular eukaryotes have experienced elevations in the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate because of substantial reductions in N(e).},

abstract = {The dominant paradigm for the evolution of mutator alleles in bacterial populations is that they spread by indirect selection for linked beneficial mutations when bacteria are poorly adapted. In this paper, we challenge the ubiquity of this paradigm by demonstrating that a clinically important stressor, hydrogen peroxide, generates direct selection for an elevated mutation rate in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a consequence of a trade-off between the fidelity of DNA repair and hydrogen peroxide resistance. We demonstrate that the biochemical mechanism underlying this trade-off in the case of mutS is the elevated secretion of catalase by the mutator strain. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence that direct selection can favour mutator alleles in bacterial populations, and pave the way for future studies to understand how mutation and DNA repair are linked to stress responses and how this affects the evolution of bacterial mutation rates.},

@article{Gueijman2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dispersal is a major factor in ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Although empirical evidence shows that the tendency to disperse varies among individuals in many organisms, the evolution of dispersal patterns is not fully understood. Previous theoretical studies have shown that condition-dependent dispersal may evolve as a means to move to a different environment when environments are heterogeneous in space or in time. However, dispersal is also a means to genetically diversify offspring, a genetic advantage that might be particularly important when the individual fitness is low. We suggest that plasticity in dispersal, in which fit individuals are less likely to disperse (Fitness-Associated Dispersal, or FAD), can evolve due to its evolutionary advantages even when the environment is homogeneous and stable, kin competition is weak, and the cost of dispersal is high. RESULTS: Using stochastic simulations we show that throughout the parameter range, selection favors FAD over uniform dispersal (in which all individuals disperse with equal probability). FAD also has significant long-term effects on the mean fitness and genotypic variance of the population. CONCLUSIONS: We show that FAD evolves under a very wide parameter range, regardless of its effects on the population mean fitness. We predict that individuals of low quality will have an increased tendency for dispersal, even when the environment is homogeneous, there is no direct competition with neighbors, and dispersal carries significant costs.},

abstract = {The dynamics of adaptation determine which mutations fix in a population, and hence how reproducible evolution will be. This is central to understanding the spectra of mutations recovered in the evolution of antibiotic resistance, the response of pathogens to immune selection, and the dynamics of cancer progression. In laboratory evolution experiments, demonstrably beneficial mutations are found repeatedly, but are often accompanied by other mutations with no obvious benefit. Here we use whole-genome whole-population sequencing to examine the dynamics of genome sequence evolution at high temporal resolution in 40 replicate Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations growing in rich medium for 1,000 generations. We find pervasive genetic hitchhiking: multiple mutations arise and move synchronously through the population as mutational 'cohorts'. Multiple clonal cohorts are often present simultaneously, competing with each other in the same population. Our results show that patterns of sequence evolution are driven by a balance between these chance effects of hitchhiking and interference, which increase stochastic variation in evolutionary outcomes, and the deterministic action of selection on individual mutations, which favours parallel evolutionary solutions in replicate populations.},

abstract = {Because mutations are mostly deleterious, mutation rates should be reduced by natural selection. However, mutations also provide the raw material for adaptation. Therefore, evolutionary theory suggests that the mutation rate must balance between adaptability-the ability to adapt-and adaptedness-the ability to remain adapted. We model an asexual population crossing a fitness valley and analyse the rate of complex adaptation with and without stress-induced mutagenesis (SIM)-the increase of mutation rates in response to stress or maladaptation. We show that SIM increases the rate of complex adaptation without reducing the population mean fitness, thus breaking the evolutionary trade-off between adaptability and adaptedness. Our theoretical results support the hypothesis that SIM promotes adaptation and provide quantitative predictions of the rate of complex adaptation with different mutational strategies.},

While others have provided a general solution to the model using geometric approaches, we derive an equivalent general solution using a probabilistic approach. Our approach to Fisher's geometric model provides alternative intuition and interpretation of the solution in terms of the model's parameters: for mutation to improve a phenotype, its relative beneficial effect must be larger than the ratio of its total effect and twice the difference between the current phenotype and the optimal one. Our approach provides new insight into this classical model of adaptive evolution.},
